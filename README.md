üìù Description
The Simple UNIX Command Interpreter is a command-line interface for UNIX-like operating systems. It allows users to interact with the system by entering commands at a prompt. The interpreter supports basic commands such as ls, cd, pwd, and exit, making it easy to navigate the file system and perform common tasks. With its simple and intuitive interface, the Simple UNIX Command Interpreter is a great tool for anyone looking to work with UNIX-like systems.

‚≠êÔ∏è Features
The program displays a prompt and waits for the user to enter a command.
Once a command is entered and the user presses the ENTER key, the command is executed and the prompt is displayed again.
The user can exit the program by entering exit, which will return a status of 0.
The program can also be stopped by pressing Ctrl+D.
The program can handle command lines with arguments and pathways.
The program supports common shell commands such as ls, grep, find, pwd, rm, cp, mv, exit, env, and history.
If an executable cannot be found, an error message is displayed and the prompt is shown again.
